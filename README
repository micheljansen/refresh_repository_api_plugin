Redmine Refresh Repository API Plugin
====================

A simple Redmine plugin that exposes repository refresh calls.

By default, Redmine does not automatically refresh commits from the repository. This can be fixed by adding a script that uses rails' script/runner to invoke Redmine commands to a Cron job or, if your set-up allows, to a post-commit hook. In some situations, these solutions just don't cut it. This plugin is designed to enable a remote (SCM) server to trigger repository refreshes in Redmine via HTTP.

Installing this plugin adds the following routes to your Redmine installation:

http://your.redmine-installation.org/repositories/refresh/project-identifier
http://your.redmine-installation.org/repositories/refresh/project-identifier.xml

GETting or POSTing to these will trigger Redmine to fetch the latest commits from the given repository.

Usage
=======

Put the `refresh_repository_api’ directory inside the vendor/plugins directory of your Redmine installation and restart the server.
The most elegant way to do this, is to use Rails’ plugin script. Inside your Redmine installation directory, perform:

script/plugin install git://github.com/micheljansen/refresh_repository_api_plugin.git

And restart the server.

Create a post-commit hook in your SCM. How exactly this works depends on your SCM, but it usually boils down to creating a shell script containing the actions to perform. For a Subversion repository, it suffices to put:

#!/bin/sh
curl http://your.redmine-installation.org/repositories/refresh/project-identifier.xml?key=YOUR_KEY_HERE
as an executable file called “post-commit” inside the hooks directory of your repository database.

The API relies on Redmine’s RSS keys to work. For a logged-in user, these can be found in any of the “Also available in: Atom” links throughout the Redmine User Interface. If, for instance, the link at the bottom of the Repository screen says:
http://your.redmine-installation.org/repositories/revisions/project-identifier?format=atom&key=1uzti1m64oeXn28FI2nORxFOfUeGApHzKE6Ii4cf
then 1uzti1m64oeXn28FI2nORxFOfUeGApHzKE6Ii4cf is your key and you should put it instead of YOUR_KEY_HERE.
